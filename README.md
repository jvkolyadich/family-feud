# family-feud
A Family Feud game created with react.  
[Try the live demo here](https://jvkolyadich.github.io/family-feud/)  

The game was designed to be able to run from a static html file, without  
the need for a server. The game display was created for a screen with a 4:3  
aspect ratio, so there may be scaling issues on screens with a different  
aspect ratio. The only browser I used it in was Chrome, so it may have issues  
in other browsers. This was created in a hurry for a Thanksgiving event, so  
it may have bugs that I didn't catch. Also, there is no support for fast  
money rounds.
