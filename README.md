# family-feud
A Family Feud game created with react.  
[Try the live demo here](https://jvkolyadich.github.io/family-feud/)  

The game was designed to be able to run from a static html file, without  
the need for a server. The only browser I used it in was Chrome, so it may  
have issues in other browsers. This was created in a hurry for a Thanksgiving  
event, so it may have bugs that I didn't catch. Also, there is no support for  
fast money rounds.
